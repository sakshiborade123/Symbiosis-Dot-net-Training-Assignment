Create a Point3D class with members x (float), y (float), and z (float).

Initialize the members in the constructor and override the ToString() method 
to return a string specifying the data of x, y, and z.

Implement the IFormattable interface on the Point3D class and 
return x, y, z individually and combined depending on the format argument passed.

Create an instance of the Point3D class in Main() and print (using Console.WriteLine) x, y, and z 
individually and combined using various formats.
